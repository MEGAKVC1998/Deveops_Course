Clouds don't ask permission to wander — they just go where the wind takes them. Sometimes silence is the loudest scream. A cup of tea and a stubborn dream — that's all I need today. Life isn’t a puzzle to solve, it’s a dance to feel. Even shadows can't exist without a little light. If the stars waited for permission, the sky would be empty. You can’t pour from an empty soul — refill often. Some days are just made for music and mischief. Woke up confused but committed to the vibe. Not all who wander are lost — some just hate Google Maps.
